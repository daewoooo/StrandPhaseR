\title{This will take sorted matrices and will calculate concordance of each single cell to the consensus haplotypes in order to assemble highly 
accurate haplotypes}
\usage{
compareSingleCellHaps(
  consensusHaps = NULL,
  sortedHaps = NULL,
  bin.size = 10,
  step = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{consensusHaps}{A \code{list} returned by function \code{\link{assembleHaps}}}

\item{sortedHaps}{A \code{list} returned by function \code{\link{sortMatrices}}}

\item{bin.size}{A size of the window measured in number of SNV to scan single cell haplotypes.}

\item{step}{A step (number of SNVs) to move the window.}
